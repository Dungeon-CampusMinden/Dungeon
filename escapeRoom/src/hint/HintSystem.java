/**
 * System that manages hints.
 *
 * <p>This system tracks entities that have both a {@link HintComponent} and a {@link
 * PlaceComponent}. Entities with tokens in their {@link PlaceComponent} are added to a unique
 * queue. Hints are provided sequentially for each entity using its {@link HintComponent}. When an
 * entity has shown all its hints, the system automatically moves to the next entity in the queue.
 *
 * <p>How it works:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Entities must have a {@link PlaceComponent} that contains tokens and a {@link
 *       HintComponent} with hints.
 *   <li>During execution ({@link #execute()}), the system checks each entity:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>If the entity has tokens, it is added to the hint queue.
 *         <li>If the entity has no tokens, it is removed from the queue. If it was the current
 *             entity showing hints, the current hint is cleared.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>Hints are accessed via {@link #nextHint()}. This method returns the next hint for the
 *       current entity.
 *   <li>When an entity has no more hints, the system automatically moves to the next entity in the
 *       queue.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>How to use it:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create entities with both a {@link PlaceComponent} (to track tokens) and a {@link
 *       HintComponent} (containing hints).
 *   <li>Instantiate the {@link HintSystem} and add it to the game.
 *   <li>Call {@link #nextHint()} to retrieve hints one by one. The system automatically handles
 *       moving to the next entity when needed.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The queue preserves insertion order and ensures that each entity appears only once. This
 * allows hints to be provided fairly and in the order entities became eligible (i.e., had tokens).
