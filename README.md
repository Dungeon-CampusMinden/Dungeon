# Dungeon

## About

The Dungeon is a tool to gamify classroom content and integrate it into a 2D Rogue-Like role-playing game.
It provides its own description language (the Dungeon Description Language) with which tasks and game content can be defined and loaded into the game. 

The Dungeon uses the [PM-Dungeon](https://github.com/Programmiermethoden/PM-Dungeon) as a framework for game development.  

## Requirements
