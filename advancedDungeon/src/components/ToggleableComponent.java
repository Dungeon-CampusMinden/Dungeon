/**
 * A generic component that represents a toggleable state (active or inactive).
 *
 * <p>This component provides common functionality for entities that can be turned on or off, such
 * as laser grids, barriers, switches, or other game mechanics. It is intended to be extended by
 * more specific components (e.g., {@code LasergridComponent}, {@code AntiMaterialComponent}) to
 * allow systems to distinguish between different toggleable entities while sharing the same
 * activation logic.
 *
 * <p>By default, the component only stores and manages its active state. Systems using this
 * component (or its subclasses) are responsible for applying gameplay and visual logic depending on
 * whether the state is active or inactive.
