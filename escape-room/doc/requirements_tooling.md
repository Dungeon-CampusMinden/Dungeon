# Dependency Graph / Story Map

We want to be able to make sure that players are able to reach the goal from every state. At the same time, there should be some level of redundancy in the ways of obtaining the goal. Dependency charts are a good way to achieve this. The dungeon's DSL also offers options to achieve something very similar ([dsl example](../../dungeon/doc/dsl/examplescripts/quickstart_task_dependency.dng)), though there seems to be no abstract type for actions.
