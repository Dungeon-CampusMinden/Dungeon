/**
 * Allow the associated entity to collect experience points (XP) and level up if enough XP is

 *
 * <p>The component stores the current character level, the amount of XP this entity has collected,
 * and the amount of XP this entity will drop if it dies. To drop XP, a {@link HealthComponent} is
 * needed. The collected XP will not be set to zero after a level up was performed.
 *
 * <p>The callback {@link #callbackLevelUp} can be used to trigger specific behavior when the
 * associated entity reaches a new character level.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #addXP(long)} to gain XP for the component. The {@link
 * contrib.systems.HealthSystem} will use this to increase the amount of XP in this component if the
 * associated entity has killed another entity with an {@link XPComponent} by the amount of {@link
 * #lootXP()} from the killed entity.
 *
 * <p>The {@link contrib.systems.XPSystem} will check if the component has collected enough XP to
 * reach the next level using {@link #xpToNextCharacterLevel()} and will then update the character
 * level and trigger the {@link #levelUp()} callback function.
 *
 * <p>The XP needed for the next level is calculated using a formula. You can set your own formula
 * with {@link #levelUPFormula(Function)}. The default formula uses a quadratic function, resulting
 * in each level requiring more XP than the previous one.
