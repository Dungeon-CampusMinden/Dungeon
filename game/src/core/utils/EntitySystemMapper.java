/**
 * Maps {@link System}s with {@link Entity}s if the filter rules are fulfilled.
 *
 * <p>This class stores a collection of systems and entities and indicates that the entities meet
 * the criteria to be processed by the systems.
 *
 * <p>The filter criteria are stored as a collection of {@link Class<? extends Component>}. If an
 * entity implements all components of this collection, it will be added to the internal list of
 * entities.
 *
 * <p>Entities must be added using {@link #add(Entity)}. This function internally checks whether the
 * filter criteria are met. When an entity is added, the {@link System#triggerOnAdd(Entity)} method
 * is executed for all systems.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #remove(Entity)} to remove an entity. When an entity is removed, {@link
 * System#triggerOnRemove(Entity)} is called for each system.
 *
 * <p>If an entity changes on the component level, {@link #update(Entity)} must be called. This
 * function checks whether the entity should be newly added or removed.
 *
 * <p>Systems can be added using {@link #add(System)} or removed using {@link #remove(System)}. When
 * a system is added, {@link System#triggerOnAdd(Entity)} is called for each stored entity.
 *
 * <p>You can query the stored entities as a stream using {@link #stream()}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #equals(Set)} methods return true if the filter rules
 * are identical.
