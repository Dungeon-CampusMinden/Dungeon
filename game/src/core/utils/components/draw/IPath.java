 * this folder.
 *
 * <p>The {@link core.components.DrawComponent} will use the given path to load and set the
 * animation.
 *
 * <p>Systems can use the enum value to set the current animation at the {@link
 * core.components.DrawComponent}.
 *
 * <p>To add your own path, simply create a new enum and implement this interface.
