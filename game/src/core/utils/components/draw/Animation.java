/**
 * An Animation is what you see when a {@link core.Entity} is drawn on the screen.
 *
 * <p>An Animation is basically just a list of different Image files.
 *
 * <p>Animations are stored inside the {@link core.components.DrawComponent}.
 *
 * <p>An Animation is split into different frames. Each frame is one picture (usually also one image
 * file).
 *
 * <p>The {@link core.components.DrawComponent} will automatically create Animations on creation
 * based on the given path, so normally you don't have to create your own instances.
 *
 * <p>An Animation can have different configurations. Use {@link #setTimeBetweenFrames} to set the
 * time between two frames. Use {@link #setLoop} to define if the Animation stops at the last frame
 * or should loop (starts from the beginning, this is the default setting).
 *
 * @see core.components.DrawComponent
