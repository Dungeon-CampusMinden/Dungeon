/**
 * Store all {@link Animation}s for an entity.
 *
 * <p>At creation, the component will read in each subdirectory in the given path and create an
 * animation for each subdirectory.
 *
 * <p>Each Animation will be created with default settings. If you want to change these settings,
 * use the methods from {@link Animation}.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #currentAnimation} to set the current animation.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #currentAnimation} to get the current active animation or use {@link #getAnimation}
 * to get a specific animation.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #hasAnimation} to check if the component has the desired animation.
 *
 * <p>If you want to add your own Animations, create a subdirectory for the animation and add the
 * path to an enum that implements the {@link IPath} interface. So if you want to add a jump
 * animation to the hero, just create a new directory "jump" in the assert-directory of your hero
 * (for example character/hero) and then add a new Enum-Value JUMP("jump") to {@link
 * AdditionalAnimations}
 *
 * <p>Animations will be searched in the default asset directory. Normally this is "game/assets",
 * but you can change it in the gradle.build file, if you like.
 *
 * <p>Note: each entity needs at least a {@link CoreAnimations#IDLE_LEFT} and {@link
 * CoreAnimations#IDLE_RIGHT} Animation.
