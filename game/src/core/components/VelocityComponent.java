/**
 * Allow associated entity to move in the dungeon.
 *
 * <p>The VelocityComponent stores the speed at which the entity can move along the x and y axes.
 *
 * <p>It also stores the current movement speed on the x and y axes. This information will be used
 * by the {@link core.systems.VelocitySystem} to move the entity at the given speed.
 *
 * <p>The current movement speed can be set by other Systems like the {@link
 * core.systems.PlayerSystem}.
 *
 * <p>Note that a positive velocity means that the entity is moving right or up, and a negative
 * velocity means that the entity is moving left/down. If the current x and y velocity is 0, that
 * means the entity is not moving.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #yVelocity(float)} or {@link #xVelocity(float)} to change the current velocity.
 * Normally you want to use the {@link #xVelocity} or {@link #yVelocity} as parameter this.
