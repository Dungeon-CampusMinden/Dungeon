/**
 * A System implements a specific game logic (a gameplay mechanic).
 *
 * <p>This class is the abstract base class for each system. It implements the basic functionality
 * each system has. For example, it allows the system to be paused and unpause.
 *
 * <p>A system will iterate over each {@link Entity} with specific {@link Component}s. The {@link
 * #accept} method checks if the entity has the needed components for the system.
 *
 * <p>If an entity has all the needed components for the system, the system will store the entity in
 * its local set.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #execute} method will execute the system logic on each entity in the set.
 *
 * <p>The execute method gets called every frame in the game loop from {@link Game#render}.
 *
 * <p>Systems are designed to be unique, so don't create two systems of the same type.
