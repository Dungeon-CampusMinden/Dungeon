/**
 * Generates a {@link LevelGraph} that can be further processed into a room-based level.
 *
 * <p>This generator is specifically designed to work in conjunction with the DSL concept and is
 * provided with a collection of entity collections. For each collection, a node in the graph is
 * created, and the collection is set as payload. The collection can be queried using {@link
 * LevelGraph.Node#entities()}.
 *
 * <p>The generator first generates a tree and then adds random edges to the tree to create a
 * diverse graph.
 *
 * <p>Each node can have a maximum of 4 neighbors, and each edge is oriented towards a {@link
 * LevelGraph.Direction} within the node. The {@link LevelGraph.Direction} indicates the side of the
 * room where the door should be placed. The edges are oriented so that a west edge from node A to B
 * corresponds to an east edge from B to A.
 *
 * <p>Edges are unidirectional.
 *
 * <p>There is no separate data type for edges; instead, the {@link LevelGraph.Node}s store an array
 * of neighboring nodes, and the index in the array indicates the {@link LevelGraph.Direction}
 * through which the nodes are connected.
