/**
 * Generates a {@link LevelGraph} that can be further processed into a room-based level.
 *
 * <p>This generator is specifically designed to work in conjunction with the DSL concept and is
 * provided with a collection of entity collections. For each collection, a node in the graph is
 * created, and the collection is set as payload. The collection can be queried using {@link
 * Node#entities()}.
 *
 * <p>The generator first generates a tree and then adds random edges to the tree to create a
 * diverse graph.
 *
 * <p>Each node can have a maximum of 4 neighbors, and each edge is oriented towards a {@link
 * Direction} within the node. The {@link Direction} indicates the side of the room where the door
 * should be placed. The edges are oriented so that a west edge from node A to B corresponds to an
 * east edge from B to A.
 *
 * <p>Edges are unidirectional.
 *
 * <p>There is no separate data type for edges; instead, the {@link Node}s store an array of
 * neighboring nodes, and the index in the array indicates the {@link Direction} through which the
 * nodes are connected.
